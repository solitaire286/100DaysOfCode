## Notes

- Loops allow us to execute the same line of code multiple times. [here](https://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops)
- 'for' loops iterate over a given sequence. (Note: Its good practice when writing 'for' loops to use the singular form of the list name it's referring to. e.g. brands => brand)
- 'while' loops repeat as long as a certain boolean condition is met.
- 'sum()' function returns a number, the sum of all items in an iterable. e.g. count = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) => sum(count) => 15

## Thoughts

Struggled a bit to wrap my head around the first exercise where I had to calculate the total and count the number of all the elements within a list 'without' using sum() or len() functions.

I guess I overcompicated it for myself by overthinking it, but I really appreciate how Angela manages to simplify each step in her solutions and explain it in a way which even a complete beginner could understand.

I believe this process of breaking things down and finding simple solutions for complicated problems will become easier as I write more code.

For now, I'm learning to read 'for' loops as: For 'this element' in 'this list', do 'this'. (This will repeat for the number of elements in the list.)
