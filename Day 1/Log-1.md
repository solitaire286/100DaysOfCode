## Thoughts

Setup the prerequisites: VS Code & Python. GitHub & Twitter to track my progress, maintain accountability and also for motivation and support.

It's been a light day of learning / re-learning the basics and I'm enjoying Angela's teaching method. She doesn't seem to over complicate and over explain. I like that.

Gives you the right amount of information to get started with the practicals. There's a lot of emphasis on practicing along the way, and she's included some well designed interactive exercises to get you coding from the get-go.

I adore her patience, positivity and sense of humor. If I'm to listen to someone teach me programming for 100 days, next to David J. Malan, Angela takes the cake.

I was getting carried away with the day 1 project. Began adding more user inputs and editing the questions to make it seem cooler. Realized I was spending too much time playing around with a basic exercise where the goal was simply to apply what you've learnt and move forward.

Day 1 = Done!
