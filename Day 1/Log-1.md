## Thoughts

Setup all the prerequisites. VS Code & Python. GitHub & Twitter to track my progress, maintain accountability and also for motivation and support.

It's been a light day of learning / re-learning the basics. But I'm enjoying Angela's teaching method. She doesn't seem to over complicate and over explain. I like that. Gives you the right amount of information to get started with the practicals. There's a lot of emphasis on practicing along the way, and she's included some well designed interactive exercises to get you coding right away.

I adore her positivity and sense of humor. If I'm to listen to someone teach me programming for the next 100 days, next to David J. Malan, Angela takes the cake.
