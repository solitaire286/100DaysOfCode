## Topics covered

- Control Flow with if / else and Conditional Operators
- Nested if statements and elif statements
- Multiple If Statements in Succession
- Logical Operators

## Notes

- Comparison Operators: > Greater than, < Lesser than, >= Greater than or equal to, <= Less than or equal to, == Equal to, != Not equal to
- Single = is used in 'Assignment', while double == is use to 'Check Equality'.
- Modulo Operator: The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.
  e.g. 6 / 2 = 3, with no remainder. Therefore 6 % 2 = 0
  e.g. 5 / 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1. Therefore 5 % 2 = 1
- Logical Operators: 'and' Returns 'True' if both statements are true. 'or' Returns 'True' if one of the statements is true. 'not' Reverses the results, returns 'False' if the result is true.
- Case Conversion: str.capitalize(), str.lower(), str.swapcase(), str.title(), str.upper()
  e.g. "Gibran".lower() ==> gibran
- count() method: Returns the number of elements with the specified value. Note: String must be in lowercase for this to work correctly.
  e.g. "gibran kaleel".count('a') ==> 2

## Thoughts

A bit disappointed it took me almost 4 days to complete day 3 of the course. Another work week and the daily 3+ hour power outages aren't making things easier either, but I still managed to get in a few blocks of time here 'n there to complete the exercises and project.

The leap year exercise is what I took most time on. Not necessarily in coding it, but I wanted to understand 'why' I was using these equations as conditionals to get the final result. This meant some googling and going through the theory behind calculating leap years.

Hit a few walls while coding the exericise. I knew what I wanted the program to do with each step, but I was lacking the knowledge in how to correctly write nested 'if/else' statements.

Googled how to check for multiple conditions within the same 'if' statement and ended up using the 'and' logical operator to make it work.

Proud for not taking the easy way out by watching Angela's solution before I got it working on my own. But it helped me to see an alternate and more simpler way in viewing and solving the problem.

Guess that's the beauty of programming. There's so many ways to solving a problem. We just have to find the most 'efficient' way to do it. Preferably in the least lines of code.

Happy to actually 'feel' my improvement compared to yesterday.

Working on the love calculator exercise, I was breaking down the problem into steps while constantly testing outputs and looking for ways to reduce the lines of code I had to write to achieve the same result by doing all the concatenations, conversions and math within the same variable.
